# Presentations

This folder contains the presentations needed to deliver this bootcamp.

Each subfolder contains the content for the presentation, including all slides in a file called `slides.md`. This markdown file contains the slides in the required format for [SliDev](https://sli.dev), a tool for presenting slides inside your browser.

To use the slides:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1. Run the following command to start SliDev:

    npx slidev
    ```

1. This will launch SliDev on your local host at port 3030. You can open the slide deck at [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030).
