To complete this event, you will need 3 things:

A GitHub account

You can use other tools instead of GitHub desktop (such as the command line), and other editors instead of VS Code, but you should only use thee if you know what you are doing. This event will focus on GitHub, GitHub desktop and VS Code

<!--

When developers build software, it is good practice to use a version control system. This is a tool where developers can store and share code, tracking all the different versions of each code file. These can be run privately, or in the cloud.

GitHub is an online code repository running in the cloud. It's where millions of developers store and share their code, and where they collaborate to build software.

Code is stores in repositories, often shortened to repos. These are code stores that one or more developers has access to, and they store a full versioned history of the code changes made over time.

GitHub is popular with open source projects. This is code that is built in the open with communities of people coming together to define the project and build software.

To work with the majority of open source projects, you will need a GitHub account. The next few steps show you the process to get signed up with GitHub. You can sign up for free, and for contributing to open source or storing your own code it is completely free.
