<!--

To complete this event, you will need 3 things:

A GitHub account
GitHub desktop
Visual Studio code

You can use other tools instead of GitHub desktop (such as the command line), and other editors instead of VS Code, but you should only use thee if you know what you are doing. This event will focus on GitHub, GitHub desktop and VS Code

# GitHub

[GitHub.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)

<!--

When developers build software, it is good practice to use a version control system. This is a tool where developers can store and share code, tracking all the different versions of each code file. These can be run privately, or in the cloud.

GitHub is an online code repository running in the cloud. It's where millions of developers store and share their code, and where they collaborate to build software.

Code is stores in repositories, often shortened to repos. These are code stores that one or more developers has access to, and they store a full versioned history of the code changes made over time.

GitHub is popular with open source projects. This is code that is built in the open with communities of people coming together to define the project and build software.

# GitHub

[GitHub.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)

<!--

NOTE: Repeated page content to make the speaker notes all fit on one presenter page without scrolling.

To work with the majority of open source projects, you will need a GitHub account. The next few steps show you the process to get signed up with GitHub. You can sign up for free, and for contributing to open source or storing your own code it is completely free.

Start by heading to github.com/signup

NOTE: Wait for the attendees to complete this step before you move on. Ask mentors to help if needed.

Step one is to enter your email

Then create a password.

Ideally use a password manager! GitHub also supports multi-factor authentication which I highly recommend you set up. If you use GitHub for work, some organizations require you to have this turned on.

NOTE: Wait for the attendees to complete this step before you move on. Ask mentors to help if needed.

<!--

Next choose your GitHub username. This is like your social handle, and is used to create your account at github.com/username

Choose wisely. If you have a social handle you use on other platforms, it's good to use the same here as it's easier to remember.

Although you can change your username, anything that mentions you in an issue or a pull request will not be updated to point to your new username. If you update then anyone accessing your old username will get redirected until someone else starts using that username.

NOTE: Wait for the attendees to complete this step before you move on. Ask mentors to help if needed.

Finally you have to enter a verification code that is sent to your email to verify that your email is correct.

# GitHub Desktop

[desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)

<!--

GitHub desktop is a desktop application to interact with GitHub.

Under the hood GitHub uses a source code control system called Git. Git was written on 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the person behind Linux. It was originally created to track the development of Linux.

Git is a command line tool, but it is easier to work with a user interface rather than remember all the Git commands. This is where GitHub desktop comes in.

Download it from desktop.github.com, then install to your machine.

If you are using Linux, then GitHub desktop is not available for you, you will need to use the command line or VS Code.

NOTE: Wait for the attendees to complete this step before you move on. Ask mentors to help if needed.

<!--

You then need to set your name and email address. This will be used to identify each commit you make, so ensure you select an email address you are happy to potentially be public.

You can add more email addresses on GitHub.com if needed.

Done! You are now signed in. We'll come back to GitHub desktop later once we start creating code.

# VS Code

[code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)

<!--

Visual Studio code is the worlds most popular developer text editor. It is majority open source and you can build and run or download VSCodium, a full version from the open source code. The official VS Code release contains copyright icons and trademarks, as well as proprietary feature monitor code to help the development team validate feature usage.

VS Code is powered by extensions that allow you to work with a huge range of programming languages, cloud services and other tools. Later in this event we will install some extensions to help.

&nbsp;

<!--

From the download page select the right version for your computer. VS Code is available on macOS, Windows and Linux. Then install as needed.

On some variants of linux you can install using

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install code`

If you are installing on Windows, it can be helpful to check the 2 'Add open with Code action' options to allow you to quickly open files or folders in VS Code from Windows explorer.

NOTE: Wait for the attendees to complete this step before you move on. Ask mentors to help if needed.
