# Best practices

## Code of conduct

Should be on event site as it applies as soon as attendees arrive. Cover during the intro, enforce

## Accessibility

Can't do everything, do what you can (mics, food, ask attendees what accommodations they need and provide where possible, or explain if you can't)

## Be mindful of attendees needs and consent to network

Not all attendees will want to network or share personal details. Any activity that involves connecting with others or taking photos should be optional and no-one should be pressurized into being involved in any activity they don't want to be a part of. Any such pressure can be a code of conduct violation, and the offender should be removed from the event.

## Pac-Man rule

The 'Pac-Man rule' is designed to provide a welcoming environment for attendees who wish to join an existing conversation. Normally when groups of people engage in a conversation they form closed circle which is discouraging for folks who wish to join in as there is nowhere to do so without moving someone out of the way.

The Pac-Man rule is that any such conversation circle should have at least one open space in the circle (similar to the open mouth on Pac-Man). This way anyone else can step into that space and join the conversation. When this happens the circle should expand to give another open space to allow others to join.

You can read more on this ['The Pac-Man rule' blog post by Eric Holscher came up with this concept](https://ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/).

## Picking a day and time

If you need to run in smaller chunks, this can be easily split into 4 shorter sessions and run at other times (for example in evenings).

When you are planning this event, think about when your audience will be available. Running on a weekend means folks with weekday school or jobs can attend, but may impact family time. Career switchers who attend bootcamps

## Encouraging networking

## Networking games

Nothing involving personal details or making people stand up and speak
Provide challenges that can be in small teams but can be done alone for those who don't want to network
Offer small prizes but be mindful of inclusivity. Avoid food items, maybe stickers or other swag.
Scavenger hunts can be fun - timed helps
