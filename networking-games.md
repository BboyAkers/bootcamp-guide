# Networking games

Nothing involving personal details or making people stand up and speak
Provide challenges that can be in small teams but can be done alone for those who don't want to network
Offer small prizes but be mindful of inclusivity. Avoid food items, maybe stickers or other swag.
Scavenger hunts can be fun - timed helps
