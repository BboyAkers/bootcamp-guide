## Doors open and breakfast

This is the same as day 1.

## Welcome

This is the same as day 1. Although these topics were covered in day 1, it is important to share the same information again as some attendees may have not attended the first day.

## Networking activity - CubeFlyer competition

As a fun opening activity, you can get attendees to compete against each other using the CubeFlyer game from day 1. The 'winner' is the player with the longest flight time.

You can read about 2 versions of this competition in the [networking activities guide](./networking-activities.md#cube-off).

## Contributions, licensing, and CLAs

This is a session that covers a very important area for contributing to open source, the legal side. When covering this session, unless the speaker is a software lawyer, it is important to state that the speaker is not a lawyer, and this is only developer level guidance, and the attendees should consult a lawyer if they have specific questions.

You can find this session in the [presentations/contributions-licensing](./presentations/contributions-licensing/) folder.

## Speaker sessions

This is a chance for local speakers to give talks on open source. You will need to find local mentors to run these sessions, but topics could include:

* How I got a job thanks to open source
* A dive into a project I contribute to
* What GitHub campus experts are

## Lunch

This is the same as day 1.

## Wrap up

At the end of the day, you will need to wrap up the event. Take a moment to thank all the mentors, and give a very quick review of the whole event.

Close by encouraging attendees to get involved with open source.
