# Open source bootcamp

This repo contains a playbook and code designed to help you to run a 2-day open source bootcamp. This bootcamp is designed as an in-person event based off our experiences running similar events at the [Microsoft Reactor](http://developer.microsoft.com/reactor).

![A photo of 24 people standing in front of a whiteboard with a banner saying Reactor. Most of the people are smiling, some are waving](img/reactor-bootcamp-aug-2022.jpeg)

## Goal of the bootcamp

The goal of this bootcamp is to take attendees from a very basic to no understanding of GitHub on a journey to not only being comfortable with collaborating on GitHub, but being ready to actively contributing to public open source projects.

### Intended audience

This event is targeted predominately at early in career developers, but would be of value to any developer who wants to get started with open source. This also includes students at Universities, High Schools, Colleges and Bootcamps who are learning to code.

This bootcamp leverages a JavaScript project to help attendees learn to make contributions, but the code is relatively simple, so anyone with a basic understanding of coding, including in different programming languages, should be able to benefit from this bootcamp.

## Run of the bootcamp

This bootcamp is designed to run as a 2-day in-person event. This is a plan for each day based off running for 6 hours a day for the 2 days of a weekend.

### Day 1 - introducing Git and GitHub

The aim of day 1 is to ensure every attendee is comfortable using Git and GitHub to collaborate on projects. This day also gives attendees a chance to get to know each other and start networking.

> If attendees are already competent GitHub users, and they only want to learn about contributing to open source then they can either skip this day, or can be encouraged to attend and mentor the rest of the attendees.

#### Doors open and breakfast

The doors should open at least 30 minutes before the event starts. Having a half hour period between the doors opening and the event starting gives attendees time to arrive, and start talking to other attendees. Ensure you have signage outside the event location indicating that the event is hosted there and the opening time to help any attendees who arrive extra early (for example trying to avoid traffic).

Once attendees arrive, give them badges with their preferred name and pronouns. These can be as simple as a sticker written on in pen.

If possible, provide breakfast. During this period encourage mentors to meet with and talk to attendees.

#### Welcome

The welcome is when the event kicks off. Attendees should be seated and ready to start the day with their laptops out.

The host(s) welcome the attendees and run through the following:

* The code of conduct including who to go to to report any violations
* Event space logistics such as WiFi details, location of toilets, fire safety etc
* The agenda for the day
* Introductions to the mentors and speakers
* Encouragements and tips to network ([Pac-Man rule](#pac-man-rule), being inclusive of those who don't want to network)

#### Get signed up with GitHub

Before attendees can get started, they need to have a GitHub account. This time is dedicated to introducing GitHub, directing folks to GitHub.com, talking through the account options and getting everyone signed up.

Whoever is hosting this section should start by directing folks to sign up with GitHub:

> Sign up at [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)

Students should be directed to the [GitHub Student Developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack). This is only available to students at full time universities and colleges, and you will need to validate with your student email address. Bootcamp students and students without an academic email address will not be able to sign up for this.

They should explain the pricing - particularly that the free account is all they need to contribute to open source. No credit card is needed, just an email address.

Whilst folks are signing up and creating their accounts, the speaker can then do a basic run through of what both Git and GitHub are.

<!-- TODO - provide a slide deck on Git and GitHub -->

Mentors will need to be on-hand to help attendees with any issues around sign up.

#### Networking opportunity - connect on GitHub

As a networking opportunity get attendees to find each other on GitHub and follow each other. This will not only foster connections between attendees, and make it easier to collaborate later on in the day, but it will also teach them about the [social connection side of GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/following-people).

> This must be optional so any attendees who do not wish to connect with others are not pressurized into doing so

#### Networking game

Encourage attendees to form small teams and complete a quick challenge. Ideas for such games are given [below in the Networking games section](#networking-games).

#### Introduction to GitHub

This session is to get attendees up to speed with GitHub concepts such as repos, commits and pull requests. GitHub provides a course on their [skills platform](https://skills.GitHub.com) that provides everything needed.

The session instructor should lead the audience through the [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) course on [GitHub skills](https://skills.GitHub.com). The instructor should work through each stage in turn, showing the video and demonstrating completing the stage, then give the attendees have time to work through it themselves. The instructor should only moving to the next stage when everyone is complete.

Mentors need to be on hand to provide support and unblock any attendees who hit issues.

#### Lunch

Lunch is an opportunity for attendees to not only rest from learning to allow ideas to cement themselves, but also provides an opportunity to re-fuel ready to learn more, and is an important time for networking.

* Provide tables so attendees can sit and eat together
* Encourage mentors to sit with attendees rather than have a 'mentors table'. Networking is important, so attendees will want to hear the mentors journey into tech and learn from them.

You can find more suggestions for the catering side of the lunch break in our [catering best practices section below](#catering).

#### Make your first contribution

This session is the attendees first opportunity to make a contribution to a 'public' GitHub repo. In this case, it is a contribution to the **CubeFlyer** game. This is a small game based off Flappy Bird that the attendees can play and make changes to.

More details are provided in the [CubeFlyer](#cubeflyer) section.

This first contribution should be instructor led. The Instructor should:

1. Walk the attendees through how to access the code repo
2. Get the attendees to fork the code
3. Show the attendees how to launch and play the game
4. Walk the attendees through the code structure
5. For their first pull request, the attendees need to add a new greeting to the `constants.js` file. The instructor should show them how to do this, then raise a pull request.
6. Walk the attendees through the pull request, along with the process for code reviews, commenting on changes and approving and merging
7. Get the attendees to add their own greeting and raise a pull request
8. Merge some of the PRs and show merge conflicts
9. Walk the attendees through resolving merge conflicts and updating their PR
10. Get all the PRs merged

#### Make your second contribution

This session is for attendees to be a bit more free-form I

### Day 2 - get started with open source

## CubeFlyer

### Set up a repo with the CubeFlyer game

### Create issues

### Setting up deployments and preview builds

### Working on more advanced changes

## How to run this event

### What the event host needs to provide

WiFi

### What attendees need to bring

Laptops

### Remote/hybrid?

One of the most valuable things to early in career developers is networking. When we have run this bootcamp in the past, 90% of attendees mentioned networking as their top reason for attending. By having an in-person event with networking activities you can enable your attendees to make these connections that are important to them.

We have not yet run this as a remote event. If you have successfully run this bootcamp as a remote or hybrid event please raise an issue with your experiences. We would love to help reach a wider audience.

Suggestions to help do so are:

* Have a central location for conversation such as a Discord server
* Ensure there are plenty of opportunities for remote networking such as games attendees can play together
* Ensure there are plenty of mentors available in the conversation tool to answer questions and provide support

## Best practices

### Code of conduct

Should be on event site as it applies as soon as attendees arrive. Cover during the intro, enforce

### Accessibility

Can't do everything, do what you can (mics, food, ask attendees what accommodations they need and provide where possible, or explain if you can't)

### Finding attendees

### Be mindful of attendees needs and consent to network

Not all attendees will want to network or share personal details. Any activity that involves connecting with others or taking photos should be optional and no-one should be pressurized into being involved in any activity they don't want to be a part of. Any such pressure can be a code of conduct violation, and the offender should be removed from the event.

### Pac-Man rule

The 'Pac-Man rule' is designed to provide a welcoming environment for attendees who wish to join an existing conversation. Normally when groups of people engage in a conversation they form closed circle which is discouraging for folks who wish to join in as there is nowhere to do so without moving someone out of the way.

![Pac-Man](img/pacman.png)

The Pac-Man rule is that any such conversation circle should have at least one open space in the circle (similar to the open mouth on Pac-Man). This way anyone else can step into that space and join the conversation. When this happens the circle should expand to give another open space to allow others to join.

You can read more on this ['The Pac-Man rule' blog post by Eric Holscher came up with this concept](https://ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/).

### Picking a day and time

If you need to run in smaller chunks, this can be easily split into 4 shorter sessions and run at other times (for example in evenings).

When you are planning this event, think about when your audience will be available. Running on a weekend means folks with weekday school or jobs can attend, but may impact family time. Career switchers who attend bootcamps

### Mentors and presenters

Mentors and presenters should ensure they have the relevant knowledge to help the attendees, including working through the Introduction to GitHub course, being comfortable with GitHub and open source, and having a working knowledge of the CubeFlyer game code.

### Catering

Food has always been an important part of human bonding. Giving attendees time to sit and eat together will help them network and make connections.

* Provide food if possible, otherwise attendees will need to be instructed to bring their own food. Even if you provide food, ensure any attendees who bring their own food are welcomed and provided with cutlery, plates etc. If you can't provide a range of drinks, always provide water. Make sure attendees are aware of what food is being provided in advance so they can plan accordingly.
* An event sponsor, such as a local tech company can be helpful here in paying for food.
* If you do provide food, try to accommodate as many dietary requirements as possible. Include vegetarian and vegan food, as well as gluten and dairy free options. Clearly label these and ensure attendees don't cross contaminate (for example using a knife with pepperoni on it to cut a vegetarian pizza).
* Avoid providing alcohol, even for the end of the day. This excludes attendees who avoid alcohol.
* Be conscious of cultural requirements around food, such as periods of fasting.
* Some attendees may wish to leave during times food is served. Make sure everyone knows what time the next portion of the day will resume so they can return in time.

### AV

### How to find speakers

### Encouraging networking

### Networking games

Nothing involving personal details or making people stand up and speak
Provide challenges that can be in small teams but can be done alone for those who don't want to network
Offer small prizes but be mindful of inclusivity. Avoid food items, maybe stickers or other swag.
Scavenger hunts can be fun - timed helps
